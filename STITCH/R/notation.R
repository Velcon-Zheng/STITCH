## some notes on notation
## _t means "transposed " i.e. rows = K, cols = SNPs/grids
## c or m suffix denotes post-S notation for only a single haplotype reference panel
## _tc means transposed and cube e.g. eHapsCurrent_tc has entries [k, iSNP, s] where s is 1 through S on number of sets of ancestral haps
## _m means matrix i.e. priorCurrent_m has entries [k, s], sigmaCurrent_m[SNP, s]
