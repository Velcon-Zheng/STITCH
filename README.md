STITCH - Sequencing To Imputation Through Constructing Haplotypes
=================================================================
**__Current Version: 1.3.0__**
Release date: March 26, 2017

Changes in latest version

1. Use SeqLib instead of Rsamtools to get read inforamtion. This speeds up analysis of BAM files and significantly speeds up analysis of CRAM files
2. Use SeqLib instead of samtools to get sample names

For details of past changes please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

STITCH is an R program for reference panel free, read aware, low coverage sequencing genotype imputation. STITCH runs on a set of samples with sequencing reads in BAM format, as well as a list of positions to genotype, and outputs imputed genotypes in VCF format.

## Installation and quick start on real data example

### Quick start on Linux and Mac

Install R if not already installed. Then
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rwdavies/STITCH.git
cd STITCH
./scripts/install-dependencies.sh
export SEQLIB_ROOT=`pwd`/SeqLib/
R CMD INSTALL ./releases/STITCH_1.3.0.tar.gz

# test on CFW mouse data
wget http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~rwdavies/ancillary/STITCH_example_2016_05_10.tgz
# or curl -O http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~rwdavies/ancillary/STITCH_example_2016_05_10.tgz
tar -xzvf STITCH_example_2016_05_10.tgz
./STITCH.R --chr=chr19 --bamlist=bamlist.txt --posfile=pos.txt --genfile=gen.txt --outputdir=./ --K=4 --nGen=100 --nCores=1
# if this works the file stitch.chr19.vcf.gz will be created
```
If you're on Mac you may see an error similar to ```ld: library not found for -lquadmath```, which is related to STITCH C++ compilation using Rcpp. This can be fixed by updating gfortran using a method such as [this](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/rcpp-rcpparmadillo-and-os-x-mavericks-lgfortran-and-lquadmath-error/).

### Interactive start
1. Install R if not already installed.
2. Install R dependencies parallel, Rcpp and RcppArmadillo from CRAN (using the "install.packages" option within R)
3. Install [bgzip](http://www.htslib.org/) and make it available to your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). This can be done using a system installation, or doing a local installation and either modifying the PATH variable using code like ```export PATH=/path/to/dir-with-bgzip-binary/:$PATH```, or through R, doing something like ```Sys.setenv( PATH = paste0("/path/to/dir-with-bgzip-binary/:", Sys.getenv("PATH")))```. You'll know samtools is available if you run something like ```system("which bgzip")``` in R and get the path to bgzip
4. Install SeqLib, either by running the script ```scripts/install-SeqLib.sh```, or by looking at the script and installing in a similar fashion.
5. Install STITCH. First, download the latest STITCH tar.gz from the releases folder above. Next, set the path to SeqLib using ```SEQLIB_ROOT=/path/to/Seqlib-folder/```. Finally install by opening R and using install.packages, giving install.packages the path to the downloaded STITCH tar.gz
6. Download example dataset [STITCH_example_2016_05_10.tgz](http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~rwdavies/ancillary/STITCH_example_2016_05_10.tgz).
7. Run STITCH. Open R, change your working directory using setwd() to the directory where the example tar.gz was unzipped, and then run ```STITCH(tempdir = tempdir(), chr = "chr19", bamlist = "bamlist.txt", posfile = "pos.txt", genfile = "gen.txt", outputdir = paste0(getwd(), "/"), K = 4, nGen = 100, nCores = 1)```. Once complete, a VCF should appear in the current working directory named stitch.chr19.vcf.gz

## Help, command line interface and common options

For a full list of options, in R, query ```?STITCH```, or from the command line, ```STITCH --help```. For a brief writeup of commonly used variables, see [Options.md](Options.md). To pass vectors using the command line, do something like ```STITCH.R --refillIterations='c(3,40)'``` or ```STITCH.R --reference_populations='c("CEU","GBR")'```.

## Examples

In the examples directory, there is a script which contains examples using real mouse and human data. One can either run this interactively in R, or run all examples using ```./examples/example.R```.

## License

STITCH and the code in this repo is available under a GPL3 license. For more information please see the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Testing

Tests in STITCH are split into unit or acceptance run using ```./scripts/test-unit.sh``` and ```./scripts/test-acceptance.sh```. To run all tests use ```./scripts/all-tests.sh```, which also builds and installs a release version of STITCH.

## Note on the selection of K and nGen

A fuller description is given the supplement of the paper given in the [citation](#citation), and this is worth a read for anyone planning to use the method in their work.

K is the number of ancestral haplotypes in the model. Larger K allows for more accurate imputation for large samples and coverages, but takes longer and accuracy may suffer with lower coverage. It is usually wise to try a few values of K and assess performance using either external validation, or the distribution of quality scores (e.g. mean / median INFO score). It is likely wise to choose K that both gives you the best performance (accuracy, correlation or quality score distribution) within computational constraints, while also ensuring K is not too large given your sequencing coverage (e.g. try to ensure that each ancestral haplotype gets at least a certain average X of coverage, say 10X, given your number of samples and average depth). 

nGen controls recombination rate between the sequenced samples and the ancestral haplotypes. It is probably fine to set it to 4 * Ne / K given some estimate of effective population size Ne. If you think your population can reasonably approximated as having been founded some number of generations ago / reduced to 2*K that many generations ago, use that generation time estimate. STITCH should be fairly robust to misspecifications of this parameter.
